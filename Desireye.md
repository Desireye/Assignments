My Zuri Week 3 to Week 5 work

This Github Repo is as a result of a task given to learn the github basics.
There is a main branch which is empty, a week 3 branch containing my portfolio task and registration task, a week 4 branch containing my flexbox and grid task, and then my week 5 task where I am putting this README. I apologise if things are not in folders, my laptop go spoilt and I'm doing everything from my phone for now.
